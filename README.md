In this project, our goal was to build an application that allows users to see how their investments will grow overtime for a bank called "Airgead Banking".
In this project, I feel like I did well in setting up the outputs to display the investments overtime. Going into it, I felt like this would be the problem area for me.
If I could enhance my code, I'd make more improvements on it's effiency. Try to go back and see if I can do more with less.
In the project, making sure the outputs work and debugging them was the most challenging part to over come. But with time, and coming back to road blocks later. I was able to overcome these challenges.
From this project, I believe that the skill of coding with c++ will be transferable to other work. I don't think that this will be the last time of me using c++. In the future, it might be at a job or another course.
What I did to make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable is to always make sure I take my time. I get frustrated when I don't understand things on the first time, so it helped to make sure to keep at it with time.
